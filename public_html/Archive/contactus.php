<h2>Who</h2>
<p>We are a group of service minded individuals that feel a calling to serve our community as Law Enforcement Officers.  Most of us have full time jobs doing things from the most menial to some high level positions in the community.  We all are bound by brotherhood of Law Enforcement, a calling to serve the community as a Peace Officer.  
</p>
<h2>What</h2>
<p>It is a dangerous job with very little and in our case often no monetary rewards.  We have to meet the same standards as the regular full time deputies, complete all the same training, and do all the same jobs.  Becoming a Sheriffs Deputy is not something to be done on a whim, it requires a tremendous commitment from the individual.  If you are interested in joining our ranks, come to one of our meetings and meet our Major.  After a preliminary interview, if you are still interested you will be given an application to start the process.
</p>
<h2>When/Where</h2>
<p>We meet on the first and third Wednesday of the month at the County Fairgrounds in Pascagoula at the Reserve Building on Vega Street.</p>
