<h2>Who we are:</h2>
	<p>The Part Time and Reserve Division of the Ocean Springs Police Department is comprised of professionally trained and duly sworn law enforcement officers who successfully completed a Full Time or Part Time Law Enforcement Academy, as outlined by the Mississippi State Board of Minimum Standards and Training for Law Enforcement Officers. Each Officer is held to the same professional standards as full-time Officers, with the same powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities. They must meet the same hiring, background, medical and psychological standards as full-time Officers, and are vested with same powers of arrest. They voluntarily give their time to support the Ocean Springs Police Department and the citizens of Ocean Springs.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2> 
	<p>Part Time and Reserve officers work side-by-side with full-time officers to provide professional law enforcement assistance to the citizens of Ocean Springs, Mississippi. They provide proactive law enforcement by patrolling residential neighborhoods, businesses and schools. They assist in search and recovery and drug task force operations, investigations, DUI enforcement, Safety Checkpoints as well as augmenting jail and detention center operations. They take on the less glamorous, but equally important tasks, such as prisoner transport, guarding inpatient prisoners at the hospital, guarding crime scenes, etc., and are typically the law enforcement component at school sporting events. This frees up full-time Officers for normal law enforcement operations. This increased manpower provides higher visibility and a greater law enforcement presence in our community.</p>
